Hey, I'm an **Applied AI Engineer** at [Workist](https://workist.com), a Berlin-based startup focused on **document understanding**. I develop AI systems that automate document processing and enhance business workflows using machine learning.

I completed my Master’s in Computer Science at **TU Berlin**, where I specialized in machine learning and **explainable AI (XAI)**. My thesis, conducted at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de), focused on applying XAI to **diffusion models** within a larger project aimed at improving lung cancer tissue imaging. The goal was to enhance the interpretability and transparency of AI models in healthcare applications.

Before my thesis, I worked on a project supporting the [ITU/WHO Focus Group on AI for Health](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx), where I helped develop an AI platform for evaluating machine learning in healthcare.

For my bachelor's thesis, I developed a web app to track the progression of Parkinson’s disease, marking the start of my interest in healthcare technologies and AI.
