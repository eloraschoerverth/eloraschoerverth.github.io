Hi, I am Elora! I am a second-year master's student in Computer Science at TU Berlin, Germany. The focus of my studies is on machine learning and distributed systems. I am especially interested in applying ML in medical image processing as well as remote sensing.

Alongside my studies I work as a student researcher at the [Department of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai.html) at [Fraunhofer HHI](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/index.html), where I lead the development of an assessment platform for machine learning in health. This platform is part of the [ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H)](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx).

Before my master's, I completed my bachelor's in Media & Computer Science at TU Berlin. For my bachelor's thesis, I developed a web application supervising the progression of Parkinson's in patients.
